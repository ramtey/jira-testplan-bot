# Test Plan Prompt Improvements

## Overview

Enhanced the LLM prompt for generating higher-quality, more actionable test plans based on industry best practices and real-world QA workflows.

## Latest Update: Build-Time vs Runtime Filtering (2026-01-27)

### Problem
Test plans were generating test cases for build-time tools and configurations that don't require manual testing:
- ESLint configuration changes
- TypeScript compiler options
- Build tool configs (webpack, vite, babel)
- CI/CD pipeline configurations

**Example issue**: An SDK update ticket (Expo SDK 52→53) included "App handles ESLint v9 flat config validation without breaking builds" as an edge case test, even though ESLint validation is automatic in the build pipeline.

### Solution
Added three key improvements to the prompt:

#### 1. "What NOT to Test" Section
New explicit section listing build-time tools to exclude:
- ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript configs
- Build tools (webpack, vite, rollup, babel, esbuild)
- Package manager configs (package.json scripts, lockfiles)
- CI/CD configs (.github/workflows, .gitlab-ci.yml)
- Development tooling (husky, lint-staged, commitlint)
- Test framework configs (jest.config.js, vitest.config.js)

**Key message**: "These fail the build automatically if broken. Manual testing adds no value."

#### 2. SDK/Dependency Update Guidance
Added specific category for SDK and library upgrades in the complexity analysis:
- Reduced test scope: 3-4 happy path (vs 5-8 for complex features)
- 2-4 edge cases focusing on breaking changes from changelog
- 4-6 regression items ensuring existing features still work
- Explicit instruction: "DO NOT test build tools (ESLint, TypeScript configs, bundler settings)"
- Example provided: "App launches on iOS with Expo SDK 53" NOT "ESLint v9 validates code"

**Focus**: Compatibility and regression testing, not testing SDK features themselves.

#### 3. Development Context Filtering
Enhanced the "Use this development context" section with explicit filtering:
- New bullet point: "**FILTER OUT build-time changes**: Ignore ESLint configs, TypeScript configs, build tool settings, CI configs - focus ONLY on runtime code (UI components, API logic, business logic, data models)"
- Ensures LLM analyzes PR file changes intelligently, skipping non-runtime files

### Impact
- ✅ **Eliminates irrelevant tests**: No more ESLint/build tool test cases
- ✅ **Focused SDK update testing**: Reduced scope from 20+ tests to 10-14 targeted tests
- ✅ **Better test quality**: Tests focus on actual user-facing behavior
- ✅ **Faster generation**: Fewer test cases to generate = faster response times
- ✅ **Lower costs**: Fewer tokens generated = reduced API costs

### Example Before/After

**Before (SK-1872 - Expo SDK Update):**
```
Edge Case:
- "App handles ESLint v9 flat config validation without breaking builds"

Regression:
- "ESLint validation passes with new v9 flat config"
```

**After (SK-1872 - Expo SDK Update):**
```
Happy Path:
- "Development build runs successfully with Expo SDK 53 on iOS device"
- "Authentication flow works correctly after React Native upgrade"

Edge Case:
- "App handles iOS SDK version check for App Store submission"
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Risk-Based Prioritization ⭐

**Before:** All test cases treated equally
**After:** Each test case has priority level (critical/high/medium)

```json
{
  "title": "User login with valid credentials",
  "priority": "critical",  // NEW
  ...
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Focus testing efforts on high-risk areas first
- Clear communication of test criticality to team
- Better resource allocation during tight deadlines

**Priority Definitions:**
- 🔴 **Critical**: Authentication, payments, data loss, security vulnerabilities
- 🟡 **High**: Core features, common user flows, data integrity
- 🟢 **Medium**: Edge cases, rare scenarios, UI polish

---

### 2. Given-When-Then Format ⭐⭐

**Before:** Loose, inconsistent step formatting
**After:** Standard Given-When-Then (Gherkin-style) format

**Before:**
```
"steps": [
  "Navigate to settings",
  "Click delete button",
  "Confirm deletion"
]
```

**After:**
```
"steps": [
  "Given: User is logged in as admin with 100+ records",
  "When: Navigate to settings and click 'Delete Account' button",
  "Then: Confirmation modal appears with warning message"
]
```

**Benefits:**
- Industry-standard format (used in Cucumber, Gherkin, BDD)
- Clearer separation of preconditions, actions, and outcomes
- Easier to automate test cases from these descriptions
- Reduces ambiguity in test steps

---

### 3. Specific Test Data Requirements ⭐⭐

**Before:** No test data specified
**After:** Each test case includes required test data

```json
{
  "title": "Admin exports user data",
  "test_data": "admin account with 100+ records, users in multiple states",  // NEW
  ...
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Testers know exactly what data to prepare
- Reduces "I don't have the right test data" blockers
- Makes test cases independently executable
- Includes specific malicious inputs for security tests (e.g., `SQL: ' OR '1'='1`)

---

### 4. Security & Integration Test Categories ⭐⭐⭐

**Before:** Only happy path + edge cases
**After:** Categorized edge cases + dedicated integration tests

**New Edge Case Categories:**
- `security`: XSS, SQL injection, auth bypass
- `boundary`: Min/max values, limits, special characters
- `error_handling`: Network failures, invalid input
- `integration`: API contracts, database operations

**New Integration Tests Section:**
```json
"integration_tests": [
  {
    "title": "API returns 401 for expired tokens",
    "priority": "critical",
    "steps": [...],
    "test_data": "expired JWT token from 2025-01-01"
  }
]
```

**Benefits:**
- Explicit security testing (catches XSS, SQL injection)
- Backend/API tests separate from UI tests
- Database transaction testing
- Service-to-service communication validation

---

### 5. Two-Phase Analysis Process ⭐

**Before:** Direct test generation
**After:** Analysis phase → Generation phase

**Phase 1: Critical Analysis**
1. Understand feature scope & complexity
2. Identify categories and variations
3. Assess risk areas
4. Determine test data requirements

**Phase 2: Generate Test Cases**
- Happy path (business value focus)
- Edge cases (risk-based prioritization)
- Integration tests (if applicable)
- Regression checklist

**Benefits:**
- More thoughtful, comprehensive test coverage
- Better risk assessment
- Contextual awareness of ticket complexity

---

### 6. Enhanced Prompt Instructions

**New additions:**
- ✅ Boundary value analysis guidance (min, max, max+1, empty, null)
- ✅ Specific security test examples (XSS payloads, SQL injection)
- ✅ Concrete test data requirements (not generic "admin user")
- ✅ Integration testing focus for backend tickets
- ✅ Observable, measurable expected outcomes
- ✅ Emphasis on Given-When-Then format

---

## UI Enhancements

### Visual Improvements

1. **Priority Badges**: Color-coded badges (🔴 Critical, 🟡 High, 🟢 Medium)
2. **Category Tags**: Edge case categories displayed (security, boundary, etc.)
3. **Test Data Section**: Dedicated section for test data requirements
4. **Integration Tests**: New section in UI for backend/API tests

### Export Format Updates

All export formats (Jira, Markdown, .md file) now include:
- Priority levels with emoji indicators
- Test data requirements
- Category labels for edge cases
- Integration tests section

---

## Example Output Comparison

### Before
```json
{
  "title": "Test login functionality",
  "steps": [
    "Enter credentials",
    "Click login"
  ],
  "expected": "User is logged in"
}
```

### After
```json
{
  "title": "User login with valid credentials successfully authenticates",
  "priority": "critical",
  "steps": [
    "Given: User has valid account (email: test@example.com, password: ValidPass123!)",
    "When: Enter credentials and click 'Log In' button",
    "Then: User is redirected to dashboard with welcome message"
  ],
  "expected": "Dashboard loads with user's name displayed in header",
  "test_data": "Valid account: test@example.com / ValidPass123!"
}
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Specific, actionable title
- ✅ Clear priority (critical)
- ✅ Given-When-Then format
- ✅ Concrete test data
- ✅ Observable expected outcome
